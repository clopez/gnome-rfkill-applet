BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

* First, install build dependencies.
  On Debian / Ubuntu just install the following packages:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libpanel-applet2-dev imagemagick

* Then build it::
    make

* And install it::
    sudo make install


Now restart your gnome session and add the applet to the panel.


SYSTEM PATHS
------------

* The paths are the standard of Debian systems and are hardcoded in the files
  "Makefile" and "src/rfkillapplet.h", change them if you need.
